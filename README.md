# NinjaSe

This is NinjaSe, an escape room game developed as part of an Individual Project for my Software Engineering class. It features a Ninja who has to move about a grid and combine obstacles in order to clear them. There are matching pairs of obstacles, and when these pairs are combined, they dissapear from the board. Once all obstacles are gone, the Ninja can escape!

## How to play

You can play by either downloading the IP.jar file and launching it, though you may need to download the NinjaSe image in order to see the Ninja's sprite. Otherwise, you can download the sourcecode and run int using your own methods. 

## What it's made with

I utilized the JavaFX/Swing graphics library in order to design a GUI with buttons and a visual representation of the escape room. The structure of the project itself follows the MVC (model-view-controller) architecture.
